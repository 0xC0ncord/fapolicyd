File Access Policy Daemon

This is a simple application whitelisting daemon for Linux.

DEPENDENCIES
============
libgcrypt-devel
rpm-devel
file-devel

BUILDING
========
To build from the repo after cloning:

cd fapolicyd
./autogen.sh
./configure
make dist

Then use the new tarball with the spec file and create your own rpm.
Sample rules are included.

NOTES
=====
One thing to note, as of the 0.8 release you can deadlock your system
if you use rpm -i/U, yum update, or dnf update.

Its highly recommended to run in permissive mode while you are testing the
daemon's policy. To see access decision use the debug option.
