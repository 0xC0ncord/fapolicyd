File Access Policy Daemon

This is a simple application whitelisting daemon for Linux.

DEPENDENCIES
============
libgcrypt-devel
rpm-devel
file-devel
systemd-devel

BUILDING
========
To build from the repo after cloning:

cd fapolicyd
./autogen.sh
./configure
make dist

Then use the new tarball with the spec file and create your own rpm.
Sample rules are included.

NOTES
=====
One thing to note, the 0.8 release can deadlock your system if you
use rpm -i/U, yum update, or dnf update.

Its highly recommended to run in permissive mode while you are testing the
daemon's policy. To see access decisions, use the debug option.

The fapolicyd.mounts file must be setup based on your partitioning scheme.
You can run:

    mount | egrep '^tmpfs| ext4| xfs' | awk '{ printf "%s\n", $3 }'

to get an initial list of things to watch.
