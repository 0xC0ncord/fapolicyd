fapolicyd-cli \- Fapolicyd CLI Tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBfapolicyd-cli\fP [\fIoptions\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The fapolicyd command line utility is a tool to tell the daemon that it needs to update the trust database. Normally, the daemon learns that the trust database needs updating because it uses a dnf plugin to inform it. However, you may install an rpm by hand and it can't see that a system package was installed or updated. Or perhaps the admin updates the fapolicyd.trust file and would like the changes to take effect immediately. In either of these cases, you would need to tell the daemon that it needs to do an update by running this command.
